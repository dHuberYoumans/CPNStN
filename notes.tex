\section{Toy model: \texorpdfstring{$0d$ GLSM}{0d GLSM}}
\subsection{Setup}
We start with a $0d$ GLSM toy model, i.e.\ we consider the source manifold $\Sigma = \{ pt \}$ to be an abstract point and the target manifold to be $X = \CP^1$.
The space of fields is then simply given by points on the target manifold $X$, namely 
\begin{equation}
  \F = \CP^1
\end{equation}
As the action of the model we consider 
\begin{equation}
  S(z_0,z_1) = \beta \Big( \lvert z_0 \rvert^2 - \lvert z_1 \rvert^2 \Big)
  \label{eq:toy_S}
\end{equation}
where $[z_0:z_1] \in \CP^1$.
As written, the partition function explicitly shows the $U(1)$ gauge freedom (which here is simply a global $U(1)$ symmetry, acting as 
\begin{equation}
  e^{i\theta}\colon (z_0,z_1) \mapsto (e^{i\theta} z_0, e^{i\theta} z_1)
\end{equation}
and defines indeed a function on $\CP^1$ if we implicitly assume the constraint 
\begin{equation}
  \lvert z_0 \rvert^2 + \lvert z_1 = 1
  \label{eq:toy_constr}
\end{equation}

The path integral of the model is thus defined by 
\begin{equation}
Z = \int dz_0 dz_1 \delta(\lvert z_0 \rvert^2 + \lvert z_1 - 1) e^{-S(z_0,z_1)}
  \label{eq:toy_Z}
\end{equation}
In order to evaluate \eqref{eq:toy_Z}, we want to embed $\CP^1$ into a higher dimensional complex space such that 
\begin{enumerate}
  \item the new action $\tilde S$ is holomorphic in the new variables (fields)
  \item when we restrict to $\CP^1$, $\tilde S$ reduces to $S$
\end{enumerate}
We think of this embedding as an analytic continuation of the space of fields in an appropriate sense.

Going to real fields, $z_k = x_k + i y_k$ for $k = 0,1$, the action \eqref{eq:toy_S} becomes 
\begin{equation}
  S = \beta\left( x_0^2 + y_0^2 - x_1^2 - y_1^2 \right)
  \label{eq:toy_S_real}
\end{equation}
while the constraint becomes
\begin{equation}
  x_0^2 + y_0^2 + x_1^2 + y_1^2 = 1
  \label{eq:toy_constr_real}
\end{equation}

\subsection{Manifold Deformation}
Suppose that we now complexify in the sense that we consider $x_k, y_k \in \CC$.
For simplicity, let us rename the variables according to 
\begin{equation}
  x_0 = u_0 \quad , \quad x_1 = u_1 \quad , \quad  y_0 = u_2 \quad , \quad y_1 = u_3
  \label{eq:toy_us}
\end{equation}
where now $u_i \in \CC$.
This slightly unusual renaming is done for later convenience.

The constraint \eqref{eq:toy_constr_real} now becomes
\begin{equation}
  \sum_{i=0}^3 u_i^2 = 1
\end{equation}
which can be seen as a complex hypersurface inside $\CP^4$, as follows: Let us introduce the complex variable $t \in \CC$ and consider the equation 
\begin{equation}
  \sum_{i=0}^3 u_i^2 = t^2
\end{equation}
This equation describes the zero set of a homogeneous quadratic polynomial 
\begin{equation}
  P(t,u_i) = t^2 - \sum_{i=0}^3 u_i^2
\end{equation}
Notice that for any $\lambda \in \CC^* = \CC - \{ 0 \}$,
\begin{equation}
  P(\lambda t, \lambda u_i) = \lambda^2 P(t,u_i)
\end{equation}
Therefore, the solution space of 
\begin{equation}
  P(u_i,t) = 0
\end{equation}
is invariant under the action of $\CC^*$ (by multiplication) and hence descends to an equation on $\CP^4$ whose coordinates are $[t:u_0:u_1:u_2:u_3]$

The important observation is that the constraint surface \eqref{eq:toy_constr_real} coincides with $P(t,u_i) = 0$ for $t=1$.
But $t=1$ simply defines the $U_{t \neq 0} \subset \CP^4$ whose coordinates are given by $\left[ 1:\tfrac{u_0}{t}:\tfrac{u_1}{t}:\tfrac{u_2}{t}\right]$.
Hence, the constraint surface can be embedded into $\CP^4$:
\begin{equation}
  [u_0:u_1:u_2:u_3] \mapsto [t(u_i):u_0:u_1:u_2:u_3] \quad , \quad t(u_i) = \sqrt{\sum_{i=0}^3 u_i^2} 
  \label{eq:toy_emb}
\end{equation}
Notice that $[t(u_i):u_0:u_1:u_2:u_3]$ simply describes a point in $P(t,u_i) = 0$ and the original surface is reproduced in the chart $t(u_i) = 1$.  

This embedding comes with a natural family of holomorphic deformations parametrised by a vector $\omega \in \CC^4 - \{ 0 \}$.
Namely, instead of considering zeros of $P(t,u_i)$, one could consider zeros of a general homogeneous quadratic polynomial 
\begin{equation}
  P_{\omega}(t,u_i) = t^2 - \sum_{i=0}^3 \omega_i u_i^2
\end{equation}
which for $\omega = (1,1,1,1) \in \CC^4$ coincides with $P$.

\begin{remark}
  Note that the hypersurface $\mathcal C_{\omega}$ defined by $P_{\omega}(t,u_i) = 0$ defines a $\CP^3 \subset \CP^4$. 
  Indeed, zeros of $P_{\omega}(t,u_i)$ are given by points 
  \begin{equation}
    [t(u_i):u_0:u_1:u_2:u_3] \quad , \quad t(u_i) = \sqrt{\sum_{i} u_i^2}
  \end{equation}
  and hence parametrised by $(u_0, \dots, u_3) \in \CC^4 - \{ 0 \}$.
  However, we may freely scale the $u_i$ by the same $\lambda \in \CC^*$ simultaneously, since $t(\lambda u_i) = \lambda t(u_i)$.
  Hence, the hypersurface $C_{\omega}$ is parametrised by $(u_0,\dots,u_3) \in \CC^4 - \{ 0 \}$ only up to the action of $\CC^*$, that is by a $\CP^3$ with coordinates $[u_0:u_1:u_2:u_3]$.
\end{remark}

\subsection{Action along the Deformed Manifold}
In the chart $t=1$, the action \eqref{eq:toy_S_real} becomes 
\begin{equation}
  S(u) = \beta \left( u_0^2 + u_1^2 - u_2^2 - u_3^2 \right)
\end{equation}
If we were to reinstate $t$, we would have to do it in a way that ensures that $S(u)$ is a function on $\CP^4$, i.e.\ invariant under the $\CC^*$ action $\lambda \colon (t,u_i) \mapsto (\lambda t, \lambda u_i)$.
An obvious candidate is 
\begin{equation}
  S(t,u) = \frac{\beta\left( u_0^2 + u_1^2 - u_2^2 - u_3^2 \right)}{t^2}
\end{equation}
On the constraint surface (inside $\CP^4$) we now replace $t^2$ by $\sum_i \omega_i u_i^2$ for some non-zero $\omega \in \CC^4$.
We obtain 
\begin{equation}
  S(t,u)\rvert_{\mathcal C_{\omega}} = \frac{\beta\left( u_0^2 + u_1^2 - u_2^2 - u_3^2 \right)}{\sum_i \omega_i u_i^2}
  \label{eq:toy_S_deformed}
\end{equation}
where we recall that we denote the (generalised) constraint surface by 
\begin{equation}
  \mathcal C_{\omega} = \{ P_{\omega}(t,u) = 0 \}
\end{equation}
Note that \eqref{eq:toy_S_deformed} is invariant under simultaneous scaling $u_i \mapsto \lambda u_i$ for any $\lambda \in \CC^*$ and thus is indeed a function on $\CP^3 \cong \mathcal C_{\omega}$.
\subsection{Integration Domain}
So far we have just discussed how the ``complexified'' space of fields embeds nicely as a $\CP^3$ into $\CP^4$. 
However, the original integration domain was a $\CP^1$ and the correct deformation domain of the path integral should be a deformation of this $\CP^1$ possibly embedded into $\CP^3 \subset \CP^4$. 
Here, we present \emph{one way} to do it.

Let us briefly recall the first steps of ``complexifying'' the space of fields: Starting with $[z_0:z_1] \in \CP^1$, we rewrite it into real fields, $z_k = x_k + i y_k$ for $k = 0,1$ and then promoted $x_k,y_k$ to complex fields $u_i$ for $i=0,\dots,3$ and ultimately we found that the resulting space is forms a $\CP^3 \subset \CP^4$ with coordinates $[u_0:u_1:u_2:u_3]$.

It is left to discuss how the $\CP^1$ embeds into this $\CP^3$, i.e. how we have to extend the coordinates $x_k,y_k$ to $u_i$. 
One way to do this is by \emph{scaling}: for some $\alpha = (\alpha_1, \dots, \alpha_3) \in \CC^4$ we set
\begin{equation}
  u_0 = \alpha_0 x_0  \quad , \quad u_1 = \alpha_1 x_1 \quad , \quad u_2 =  \alpha_2 y_0 \quad , \quad u_3 = \alpha_3 y_1 
  \label{eq:toy_deform_contour}
\end{equation}
This scaling has the advantage that it preserves the polynomial degree of $x_k,y_k$, and hence of the original complex coordinates $z_0,z_1$, as well as the homogeneity.
In turn, this implies that we preserve the action of $\CC^*$. 
Put differently, the deformation (or analytical continuation) of $x_k,y_k$ to $u_i$ is \emph{equivariant}, namely for any $\lambda \in \CC^*$
\begin{equation}
  u_i(\lambda x,\lambda y) = \lambda u_i(x,y)
\end{equation}
Due to this equivariance, the deformation $z_k \leadsto u_i$ can be seen as a deformation of $\CP^1$ \emph{inside} $\CP^3 \subset \CP^4$, since 
\begin{equation}
  \begin{split}
    \begin{matrix}
      u \colon  \CC^2 \to \CC^4 \\
  (z_0,z_1) \mapsto u(z_0,z_1) \equiv (u_0(z_0,z_1),u_1(z_0,z_1),u_2(z_0,z_1),u_3(z_0,z_1))
\end{matrix}
\end{split}
\end{equation}
descends to a map from $\CP^1$ to $\CP^3$ due to its equivariance property 
\begin{equation}
  u(\lambda z_0,\lambda z_1) = \lambda u(z_0,z_1)
\end{equation}
which simply means that we can consider the quotient by $\CC^*$ on both sides (domain and codomain).

The full path integral domain would then be deformed as follows:
\begin{equation}
  \EE_{\alpha,\omega} \colon \CP^1  \stackrel{u_{\alpha}}{\hooklongrightarrow}  \CP^3  \stackrel{P_{\omega}}{\hooklongrightarrow}  \CP^4
  \label{eq:toy_E}
\end{equation}
The first map is given by 
\begin{equation} 
  u_{\alpha} \colon [z_0:z_1] = [x_0 + i y_0:x_1 + i y_1] \mapsto [\alpha_0 u_0 : \dots : \alpha_3 u_3 ]
  \label{eq:toy_cont_deform1}
\end{equation}
with $u_i = u_i(z_0,z_1)$ given by \eqref{eq:toy_us}.
The second map is given by 
\begin{equation}
  P_{\omega} \colon [u_0:u_1:u_2:u_3] \mapsto [P_{\omega}(u_i):u_0:u_1:u_2:u_3]
\end{equation}
where $P_{\omega}(u_i) = \sqrt{\sum_i \omega_i u_i^2}$.
The full embedding $\EE_{\alpha,\omega}$ is hence parametrised by two complex vectors, $\alpha \in \CC^4$ and $\omega \in \CC^4$, which gives 8 complex or equivalently 16 real parameters which can be tuned to maximize the StN.

\begin{remark}
For $x_k + i y_k$ for $k=0,1$, the embedding $\EE_{\alpha,\omega}$ can be explicitly expressed as 
\begin{equation}
  \EE_{\alpha,\omega}(x,y) = [\sqrt{\omega_0 \alpha_0^2 x_0^2 + \omega_1 \alpha_1^2 x_1^2 + \omega_2 \alpha_2^2 y_0^2 + \omega_3 \alpha_3^2 y_1^2 }: \alpha_0 x_0 : \alpha_1 x_1: \alpha_2 y_0 : \alpha_3 y_1]
\end{equation}
\end{remark}
